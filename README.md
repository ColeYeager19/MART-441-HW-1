# MART-441-HW-1
It has been a while since I have done anything with HTML so I realized during this project just how rusty my skills are. I apoligize in advance for the layout of my code and the simplicity, i wish it were a little cleaner to read. Overall I'm not thrilled with how the project turned out. I was never clear on the concept of RWD in my last course and struggled trying to find an explaination online. The limited time I was able to spend made it so that the site is not at all responsive. By the next project I will have remedied this lack of knowledge but it bothers me to be so unprepared this week. The other primary issue I had was with the setup on Github. I primarily code in DreamWeaver and Github has a few settings that entirely destroyed the links I had in my code. I spent no less than 40 minutes attempting to relink photos only to find that all I needed was to remove a line between the div class and image. At the end of the day I feel as though I've regained some of my knowledgebase for HTML but I'll have to allow myself more time next week to knock the rest of the rust off.
