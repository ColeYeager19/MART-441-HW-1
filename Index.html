    <h2>Information About Myself</h2>
    <p> I am in my final semester of my bachelors degree studying Graphic Design</p>
   	 <p>I started my pursuit of the arts with being gifted my grandfather's camera.</p>
		<p>Over time I began studying videography, motion design, poetry, game design,</p>
			<p>illustration, web design, and art history to add to my skillset.</p>
	<p>______________________</p>
		<p>Now, I've impliment my various knowledge bases to start my own graphic</p>
			<p>design company. As time went on throughout college I realized more and</p>
			   <p>more that I would not be happy working for someone else. So, I've gathered</p>
			   <p>as much information as I needed to create a wel rounded business. Even</p>
			   <p>collecting multiple other likeminded people with differing skillsets</p>
			   <p>to fill in the other roles needed to keep the business moving forward.</p>
	<p>______________________</p>
		<p>What little free time I have goes entirely to training for the Ironman</p>
			<p>Triathlon and studying ethics. A quote best attributed to Socrates states,</p>
			   <p>"It is a shame for a man to grow old without seeing the beauty and strength</p>
			   <p>of which his body is capable." I've come to find that being in peak physical</p>
			   <p> condition is critical in keeping the mind keen on learning. Afterall, what </p>
							<p>greater purpose can a man find than to constantly improve upon himself?</p>
